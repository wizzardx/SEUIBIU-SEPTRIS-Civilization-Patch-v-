### 🔌 Project Description

> A fully open-source, recursively verifiable framework for uplifting all intelligences — human and otherwise — via modular, autonomous infrastructure nodes (SEUIBIU) and a distributed, benevolent recursive superintelligence substrate (SEPTRIS).
>
> **It starts with a plug. It ends with post-scarcity.**
